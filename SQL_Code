// 🔧 Project Theme: E-commerce Analytics for Sales & Customer Insights

// Use Case:

// An online retail company wants to analyze its sales, customer behavior, and product performance across regions to optimize marketing, inventory, and logistics.

// creation of warehouse ---- its like team working

CREATE WAREHOUSE ecommerce_wh
WITH WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'XSMALL'
AUTO_SUSPEND = 60
AUTO_RESUME = TRUE;

// creation of database --- its like workdesk

CREATE DATABASE ecommerce1_db;
USE DATABASE ecommerce1_db;

// creation of schema ---- its like drawer of the desk 

CREATE SCHEMA raw;
USE SCHEMA raw;

// table creation ----- its like folder in that drawer 

create or replace table raw.inventory(
 product_id varchar,
 warehouse_location varchar,
 stock_qty integer
);

//copy into raw.inventory
//from @%inventory
//file_format= (type = 'CSV' field_optionally_enclosed_by = '"' skip_header = 1 ); 

create schema if not exists analytics;
// Why? Segregating raw data from modeled (cleaned/transformed) data keeps your environment clean and production-grade.

// Creating Star Schema Why Star Schema? Simplifies joins for BI tools and improves query performance due to fewer joins & denormalized structure.

// here star schema is analytics

// create dimension table 

//din_customers

create or replace table analytics.dim_customer as
select distinct 
customer_id,
initcap(first_name) as first_name,
initcap(last_name) as last_name,
lower(email) as email,
city,
country,
signup_date,
from raw.customers;

//dim_products

create or replace table analytics.dim_product as
select distinct
product_id,
initcap(product_name) as product_name,
category,
price
from raw.products;

// now we will create date table, its very crucial for data analytics, as it will help bi user to filter by month, quarter, year, weekdays weekends etc

create or replace table analytics.dim_date as
with dates as ( 
select dateadd(day , seq4(), '2022-01-01') as full_date
from table(generator(rowcount => 1000))
)
select
full_date,
extract(year from full_date) as year,
extract(month from full_date) as month,
extract(day from full_date) as day,
to_char(full_date, 'day') as day_of_week,
to_char(full_date, 'month') as month_name,
case when dayofweek(full_date) in (1,7) then 'weekend' else 'weekday' end as day_type
from dates;

//📌 Why? dim_date gives powerful date-level reporting (weekly trends, weekend vs weekday, seasonality, etc.)

// now we will create a fact table, its plays very crucial part in data modeling in BI

create or replace table analytics.fact_sales AS
select 
oi.order_id,
oi.product_id,
o.customer_id,
o.order_date,
o.order_status,
oi.quantity,
oi.price,
(oi.quantity * oi.price) as total_amount,
from raw.orders o
join raw.order_items oi
on o.order_id = oi.order_id;

//📌 Why? This consolidated table holds transaction-level data, ideal for computing revenue, sales volume, and linking to customers, products, and dates.


//As we have segregated all our data from raw schema to star schema, also created fact table as well, now we will dive into actual bussiness question

// “What are the top 5 selling products by quantity?”

Select 
P.product_name ,
sum(F.QUANTITY) as total_quantity 
from analytics.fact_sales F
join analytics.dim_product P On p.product_id = f.product_id
group by p.product_name
order by total_quantity desc
limit 5;

// 📌 Interview Insight: Shows understanding of inner joins, GROUP BY, and filtering logic.

// 🔹 STEP 2: Join with Multiple Dimensions (Customer + Product + Date)

select
c.first_name || '' || c.last_name as Full_name,
p.product_name,
d.full_date as order_date,

//📌 Why? Real-world dashboards often blend customer, product, and time dimensions. Shows you understand star schema design.

// 🔹 STEP 3: Use Window Function — RANK() per Category
// Business Question: “Top 3 products in each category by revenue.”

select * from (
select

// 📌 Interview Relevance: Window functions (especially RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), LAG(), LEAD()) are high-frequency interview questions.

// 🔹 STEP 4: Use CASE for Customer Segmentation Business Question: “Segment customers based on total spend.”

SELECT

// 🔹 STEP 5: Create Reusable View
// 📌 Why? Creating views shows you know how to build layered architecture for BI tools (Power BI, Tableau, etc.)

// Project day 4 : 📅 Day 4: Performance Tuning in Snowflake
// 🔹 STEP 1: Understand Micro-Partitioning (Auto Behavior)

SELECT

    row_count,
    bytes,
    table_type
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.TABLES
WHERE table_schema = 'ANALYTICS'
  AND table_name = 'FACT_SALES';

// 💡 Why run this? You’d run this to: See how big your table is 🧱 Check if it’s clustered for performance 🚀 Know how many rows it has 📊 Understand the storage usage 🧠

// 🔹 STEP 2: Use SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION for Skew Check
SELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('ANALYTICS.FACT_SALES');

// Why? When you frequently query/filter by product_id or customer_id, clustering improves performance.

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE analytics.fact_sales_clustered
CLUSTER BY (product_id, customer_id) AS
SELECT * FROM analytics.fact_sales;



SELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('ANALYTICS.FACT_SALES_CLUSTERED');

//📌 Real-world tip: Don’t over-cluster; it’s only worth it on large tables (millions+ rows).
